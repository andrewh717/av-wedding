# av-wedding
This is the website that I built for my wedding! Instead of going with the free options provided by The Knot, I chose to build my own website and took it as an opportunity to learn React and Firebase. The UI is built with React, MUI, and Bootstrap 5. I'm using Firebase for hosting and database storage.

            throughout the night that we will share later. The last thing we want is people showing
            up in photos of the ceremony with their phones out!{' '}

            No problem! We know for certain that there will be vegetarian options, but for further
            dietary restrictions just reach out to us and we will gladly contact the venue to ensure

            incredible and we definitely don't want you to miss out!

          Andrew and Vanessa met at Rutgers in August 2015. While Vanessa had gone to a large public
          school whose senior student body proceeded to Rutgers in swarms like Brood X cicadas,
          Andrew basically knew no one at school entering freshman year. He did know a friend of a
          friend that was living in BEST Hall so he decided to meet up with her in one of the
          first few weeks of orientation. It just so happened that Vanessa was that friend's
          roommate! They began hanging out around campus, getting bubble tea together, and even went
          to one of those RUSA-sponsored concerts. Andrew's infectiously geeky charm made Vanessa
          fall head over heels for him, and they started dating September 13, 2015. They have been
          inseparable ever since and live together with their loving cat, Oreo.

            Andrew and Vanessa met at Rutgers in August 2015. While Vanessa knew a lot of people
            from her high school that went on to Rutgers, Andrew basically knew no one at school
            entering freshman year. He did know a friend of a friend that was living in BEST Hall so
            he decided to meet up with her in one of the first few weeks of orientation. It just so
            happened that Vanessa was that friend's roommate! They began hanging out around campus,
            getting bubble tea together, and even went to one of those RUSA-sponsored concerts.
            Andrew quickly found himself attracted to (and intimidated by) Vanessa. He knew that he
            wasn't the only guy who wanted a shot with her, so he had to act fast before she fell
            for someone else. Andrew's infectiously geeky charm and his "preppy boy" attire made
            Vanessa fall head over heels for him, and they started dating September 13, 2015. They
            have been inseparable ever since and live together with their loving cat, Oreo.
